                    impacts of climate change. If left unchecked, entire populations might experience the effects,
                    already struggling services will be further stressed, and city governments could find themselves
                    unable to protect their citizens. What is being done in our cities to fortify and guard against the
                    growing impacts of climate change? Are there cities on the global map that others can learn from?
                    What are the most essential steps to take right now?</p>

                                            <p>Raised in Toronto, Canada, Frank Gehry moved in 1947 with his family to Los Angeles where he subsequently received his Bachelor of Architecture degree at the University of Southern California in 1954. Upon graduating, he enlisted in the US Army and with the assistance of the GI Bill, he studied City Planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design until 1957. Since then, Mr. Gehry has built an architectural career that has spanned over six decades and he has produced public and private buildings throughout the world. Hallmarks of Mr. Gehry’s work include a particular concern that people exist comfortably within the spaces and an insistence that his buildings address the context and culture of their sites all while staying within the client’s budget.</p>

                                            <p>Mr. Gehry’s contribution to the field of architecture has earned him some of its most significant recognitions beginning with his induction into the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects in 1974. The honor became the first of the over 100 national and regional awards he has since received from the organization including the distinguished Gold Medal in 1999. In addition to being awarded the 1989 Pritzker Architecture Prize, perhaps the premiere honor in the field, other notable recognitions include the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1977), the Wolf Prize in Art (Architecture) from the Wolf Foundation (1992), and he was the first recipient of the Friedrich Kiesler Prize (1998). Other major architecture acknowledgments include the 2000 Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of Architects, the 2002 Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the 2008 Golden Lion Lifetime Achievement Award at the Venice Biennale, and the National Sculpture Society’s 2021 Henry Hering Art and Architecture Award for the distinguished use of sculpture in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington D.C.</p>
